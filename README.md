### 1. Open Source Project: 
        * Create virtual reality surgical simulations, in order to train surgeons on complex procedures.
    
    
### 2. Business Model:
        * Utilize existing open source virtual reality applications and then package these components together to cater to the clients needs. For example, the client will be a hospital, and the business will provide support and customization of VR surgical simulations at a cost to the hospital. The development of these specialized applications created will then be open to the public. 
    
    
    
### 3. License and why?
        * The license i would choose is the MIT license. 
        * A few reasons as to why, the professor has much more experience within the open source world and prefers the MIT license, this says something about the usefullness of the MIT license. Also, the MIT license is pretty flexible, for example, the MIT license permirts reuse within proprietary software. So i can take software under the MIT license and create a software solution that can generate revenue from the source code alone. The MIT license is also compatible with many copyleft licenses such as the GNU GPL. THe MIT license can even be re-licensed as GPL software and even integrated within other GPL software. The flexibility of the MIT license seems like a great fit for the business model above.
